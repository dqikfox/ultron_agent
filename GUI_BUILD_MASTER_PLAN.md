# GUI Build Master Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive, step-by-step plan for building the next-generation Ultron Agent GUI, incorporating NVIDIA NIM advice, accessibility, automation, and advanced AI integration.

## 1. Requirements & Research
- Gather all user, accessibility, and business requirements
- Analyze NVIDIA NIM and other AI model recommendations
- Review current GUI limitations and user feedback
- Document all findings in `GUI_REQUIREMENTS.md`

## 2. Architecture & Technology Selection
- Choose frontend stack (e.g., React, Electron, PyQt, or hybrid)
- Define backend-GUI communication (Socket.IO, REST, gRPC, etc.)
- Plan modular structure for plugins, themes, and accessibility
- Document architecture in `GUI_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## 3. Design & Prototyping
- Create wireframes and user flows for all major screens
- Design cyberpunk/accessible theme variants
- Prototype with Figma or similar tools
- Document designs in `GUI_DESIGN.md`

## 4. Component Specification
- List all UI components (menus, panels, chat, automation controls, etc.)
- Specify props, events, and accessibility for each
- Document in `GUI_COMPONENTS.md`

## 5. Implementation Roadmap
- Break down build into phases (core, advanced, integrations, polish)
- Assign tasks, estimate timelines, and define milestones
- Document in `GUI_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`

## 6. Testing & QA
- Define test plan (unit, integration, accessibility, user testing)
- Set up CI/CD for GUI builds
- Document in `GUI_TEST_PLAN.md`

## 7. Documentation & Handover
- Prepare user and developer guides
- Document all APIs, extension points, and theming
- Document in `GUI_DOCUMENTATION.md`

Each step above will have its own detailed markup document for traceability and collaboration.
