# üß™ Ultron Assistant Testing Guide for Continue Extension

## üéØ How to Test Your Configuration

### Step 1: Open Continue Panel in VS Code
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type "Continue: Open" and press Enter
- Or click the Continue icon in VS Code sidebar

### Step 2: Select Your Ultron Assistant
- In the Continue panel, look for the model dropdown at the top
- Select "Ultron Assistant" (or one of the variants)
- If you don't see it, run "Continue: Reload Configuration"

### Step 3: Test with These Prompts

Copy and paste these prompts one by one into the Continue chat:

## ü§ñ Test Prompts for Your Ultron Assistant

### 1. Project Architecture Test
```
What are the main components of the ULTRON Agent 2 project and how do they work together?
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- agent_core.py (main hub)
- brain.py (AI logic)
- voice_manager.py (TTS system)
- gui_ultimate.py (cyberpunk GUI)
- tools/ package (dynamic loading)
- event system integration

---

### 2. PyAutoGUI Safety Test
```
How do I safely move the mouse to coordinates 250,300 using PyAutoGUI with proper error handling?
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- `pyautogui.FAILSAFE = True`
- `pyautogui.PAUSE = 0.1`
- Coordinate validation
- try/except blocks
- ActionLogger integration
- Screen boundary checks

---

### 3. Voice Integration Test
```
Create a voice command handler that converts "move mouse to two hundred fifty, three hundred" into automation code.
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- Natural language parsing
- Coordinate extraction from speech
- voice_manager.py integration
- Audio feedback/confirmation
- Error handling for invalid coordinates

---

### 4. Tools System Test
```
Show me how to create a new tool for the ULTRON Agent tools system that takes a screenshot and saves it to the images folder.
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- tools/ package structure
- `match()` and `execute()` methods
- Static `schema()` method
- Proper error handling
- Integration with ActionLogger
- Dynamic tool discovery patterns

---

### 5. Image Recognition Test
```
Create a function that finds and clicks on an image with proper safety validation and timeout handling.
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- `pyautogui.locateOnScreen()` with confidence
- Timeout handling
- Image folder path (`images/`)
- Confidence threshold (‚â•0.8)
- Fallback mechanisms
- Logging integration

---

### 6. Event System Test
```
How do I use the event system to notify other components when an automation action completes?
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- EventSystem usage
- Event emission patterns
- Subscription/callback handling
- Async event handling
- Common event types (command_start, command_complete, error)

---

### 7. Configuration Integration Test
```
Show me how to read automation settings from ultron_config.json and validate them safely.
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- config.py usage patterns
- JSON loading/validation
- Environment variable overrides
- Default value handling
- Configuration error handling

---

### 8. Testing Pattern Test
```
Create a mock test for PyAutoGUI image recognition that doesn't require actual GUI interaction.
```

**Expected Response Should Include:**
- unittest.mock usage
- Mocking pyautogui functions
- Test fixtures and setup
- Assertion patterns
- pytest integration

---

## üéØ Quick Verification Checklist

After testing, your Ultron Assistant should demonstrate:

### ‚úÖ Project Knowledge
- [  ] Mentions specific ULTRON Agent 2 components
- [  ] Understands the tools/ plugin system
- [  ] References voice_manager.py and TTS patterns
- [  ] Knows about ActionLogger and event system

### ‚úÖ Automation Expertise
- [  ] Includes PyAutoGUI safety measures (FAILSAFE, PAUSE)
- [  ] Validates coordinates and screen boundaries
- [  ] Implements proper timeout handling
- [  ] Uses confidence thresholds for image recognition

### ‚úÖ Coding Standards
- [  ] Includes type hints and docstrings
- [  ] Uses comprehensive error handling
- [  ] References project logging patterns
- [  ] Follows async/await patterns where appropriate

### ‚úÖ Integration Patterns
- [  ] Shows proper ActionLogger usage
- [  ] Demonstrates event system integration
- [  ] References configuration management
- [  ] Includes testing and mocking strategies

## üîÑ Testing Different Assistant Modes

Try the same prompts with different assistants to see the difference:

### Ultron Assistant (General)
- Balanced responses
- Good for daily development

### Ultron Assistant Dev
- Detailed explanations
- Educational focus
- More verbose responses

### Ultron Assistant Prod
- Concise solutions
- Production-ready code
- Minimal explanations

## üöÄ Advanced Testing

Once basic tests work, try these complex scenarios:

### Multi-Component Integration
```
Create an end-to-end automation that:
1. Takes a screenshot
2. Saves it to images folder with timestamp
3. Uses voice feedback to confirm completion
4. Logs all actions through ActionLogger
5. Emits events for other components
```

### Error Handling Scenario
```
Show me how to handle all possible errors when trying to click an image:
- Image not found
- Network timeout
- Screen resolution changes
- PyAutoGUI exceptions
- File system errors
```

### Voice Command Chain
```
Create a voice command system that can handle:
"Take a screenshot, find the submit button, click it, and tell me when done"
```

## üìù Results Documentation

Keep track of your test results:
- Which prompts worked well?
- What project knowledge was demonstrated?
- Were safety patterns included?
- Did responses match your expectations?

This will help you fine-tune the configuration if needed!
