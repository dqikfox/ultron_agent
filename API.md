# API Development Guide

##  API Integration Patterns

### Amazon Q Integration
```python
# Example: Using Amazon Q suggestions in code
class UltronAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Amazon Q will suggest completions here
        self.ai_assistant = None
        self.context = {}
    
    async def process_request(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Let AI assistants help with implementation
        pass
```

### GitHub Copilot Best Practices
```python
# Write descriptive comments for better suggestions
def analyze_data(dataset: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze dataset and return statistical summary
    - Calculate descriptive statistics
    - Identify outliers
    - Generate insights
    """
    # Copilot will suggest implementation based on comment
    pass
```

##  Development Workflow

### 1. AI-Assisted Coding
- Start with clear comments describing functionality
- Use descriptive variable names
- Let AI suggest implementations
- Review and refine suggestions

### 2. Code Review with AI
- Ask Amazon Q to review code sections
- Use Copilot for code optimization suggestions
- Leverage multiple AI tools for comprehensive review

### 3. Testing Strategy
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock

class TestUltronAgent:
    """AI will help generate test cases"""
    
    def test_initialization(self):
        # AI suggests test implementation
        pass
    
    def test_process_request(self):
        # Let AI create comprehensive tests
        pass
```

##  Performance Monitoring

### AI Tool Performance
- Monitor suggestion acceptance rate
- Track development speed improvements
- Measure code quality metrics

### System Resources
```python
import psutil
import logging

def monitor_ai_tools():
    """Monitor resource usage of AI extensions"""
    # AI will suggest monitoring implementation
    pass
```
