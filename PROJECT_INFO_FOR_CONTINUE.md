# Ultron Agent Project Information for Continue Extension

## ü§ñ Project Overview
**Ultron Agent** is an advanced, self-improving AI-powered automation assistant with voice, vision, GUI automation, and intelligent task execution. It is designed for extensibility, reliability, and maximum productivity, with a focus on modularity and future-proofing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+ (asyncio, FastAPI, event-driven core)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript (cyberpunk theme, modular UI)
- **AI Engine**: Qwen2.5-VL via Ollama (multimodal, local LLM)
- **Voice System**: Whisper STT, pyttsx3 TTS, Microsoft David fallback
- **Vision**: OpenCV, PIL, screenshot & camera integration
- **Automation**: Enhanced PyAutoGUI (25+ advanced features)
- **Communication**: Socket.IO for real-time bidirectional comms
- **Auto-Improvement**: Maverick Engine (self-research, code improvement, auto-apply)

### Key Features
- **Maverick Auto-Improvement System**: Detects, researches, and applies code/project improvements automatically or with user approval
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Voice, text, vision, and file input/output
- **AI Model Management**: Ollama, OpenAI, NVIDIA NIM, Together.xyz, model switching and monitoring
- **System Automation**: Full desktop automation (mouse, keyboard, window, file, screenshot, macro, workflow)
- **Advanced GUI**: Modular, themeable, accessible, with drag & drop, real-time monitoring, and plugin support
- **Security**: Role-based access, API key management, audit logging, encryption
- **Business Intelligence**: Data visualization, analytics, reporting, workflow optimization
- **Remote & Mobile**: Cloud sync, mobile companion, remote desktop, multi-device
- **Future-Ready**: AR/VR, quantum, neural, IoT, blockchain, and more (see roadmap)

### Project Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Maverick, core GUI, PyAutoGUI, model management)
- **Phase 2**: Advanced Integration (workflows, analytics, web, dev tools, security)
- **Phase 3**: Intelligence (AI/ML, cloud/mobile, IoT, business modules)
- **Phase 4**: Future Tech (AR/VR, quantum, neural, advanced integrations)

### Current Status
- **Maverick Engine**: Integrated and providing input into all build phases
- **GUI**: Undergoing complete redesign for modern, modular, and accessible experience (legacy GUI deprecated)
- **Automation**: PyAutoGUI and workflow engine in progress
- **AI**: Multi-model, multi-backend, with local and cloud LLMs
- **Documentation**: Full specs, architecture, and implementation plans in repo
