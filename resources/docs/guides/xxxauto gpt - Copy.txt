Getting Started with AutoGPT: Self-Hosting Guide¶
Introduction¶
This guide will help you setup the server and builder for the project.

Warning

DO NOT FOLLOW ANY OUTSIDE TUTORIALS AS THEY WILL LIKELY BE OUT OF DATE

Prerequisites¶
To setup the server, you need to have the following installed:

Node.js
Docker
Git
Checking if you have Node.js & NPM installed¶
We use Node.js to run our frontend application.

If you need assistance installing Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

NPM is included with Node.js, but if you need assistance installing NPM: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

You can check if you have Node.js & NPM installed by running the following command:


node -v
npm -v
Once you have Node.js installed, you can proceed to the next step.

Checking if you have Docker & Docker Compose installed¶
Docker containerizes applications, while Docker Compose orchestrates multi-container Docker applications.

If you need assistance installing docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

Docker-compose is included in Docker Desktop, but if you need assistance installing docker compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

You can check if you have Docker installed by running the following command:


docker -v
docker compose -v
Once you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can proceed to the next step.

Raspberry Pi 5 Specific Notes
Setup¶
Cloning the Repository¶
The first step is cloning the AutoGPT repository to your computer. To do this, open a terminal window in a folder on your computer and run:


git clone https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT.git
If you get stuck, follow this guide.
Once that's complete you can continue the setup process.

Running the backend services¶
To run the backend services, follow these steps:

Navigate to the autogpt_platform directory inside the AutoGPT folder:


 cd AutoGPT/autogpt_platform
Copy the .env.example file to .env in autogpt_platform:


 cp .env.example .env
This command will copy the .env.example file to .env in the supabase directory. You can modify the .env file to add your own environment variables.
Run the backend services:


 docker compose up -d --build
This command will start all the necessary backend services defined in the docker-compose.combined.yml file in detached mode.
Running the frontend application¶
To run the frontend application open a new terminal and follow these steps:

Navigate to frontend folder within the autogpt_platform directory:

 cd frontend
Copy the .env.example file available in the frontend directory to .env in the same directory:

 cp .env.example .env
You can modify the .env within this folder to add your own environment variables for the frontend application.

Run the following command:

 corepack enable
 pnpm install
 pnpm dev
This command will enable corepack, install the necessary dependencies with pnpm, and start the frontend application in development mode.
Checking if the application is running¶
You can check if the server is running by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes:

By default the application for different services run on the following ports:

Frontend UI Server: 3000 Backend Websocket Server: 8001 Execution API Rest Server: 8006

Additional Notes¶
You may want to change your encryption key in the .env file in the autogpt_platform/backend directory.

To generate a new encryption key, run the following command in python:


from cryptography.fernet import Fernet;Fernet.generate_key().decode()
Or run the following command in the autogpt_platform/backend directory:


poetry run cli gen-encrypt-key
Then, replace the existing key in the autogpt_platform/backend/.env file with the new one.

Note

The steps below are an alternative to Running the backend services

Alternate Steps
Starting the AutoGPT server without Docker¶
To run the server locally, start in the autogpt_platform folder:


cd ..
Run the following command to run database in docker but the application locally:


docker compose --profile local up deps --build --detach
cd backend
poetry run app
Starting the AutoGPT server with Docker¶
Run the following command to build the dockerfiles:


docker compose build
Run the following command to run the app:


docker compose up
Run the following to automatically rebuild when code changes, in another terminal:


docker compose watch
Run the following command to shut down:


docker compose down
If you run into issues with dangling orphans, try:


docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans && docker-compose up --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes --remove-orphans  
📌 Windows Installation Note¶
When installing Docker on Windows, it is highly recommended to select WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V. Using Hyper-V can cause compatibility issues with Supabase, leading to the supabase-db container being marked as unhealthy.

Steps to enable WSL 2 for Docker:¶
Install WSL 2.
Ensure that your Docker settings use WSL 2 as the default backend:
Open Docker Desktop.
Navigate to Settings > General.
Check Use the WSL 2 based engine.
Restart Docker Desktop.
Already Installed Docker with Hyper-V?¶
If you initially installed Docker with Hyper-V, you don’t need to reinstall it. You can switch to WSL 2 by following these steps: 1. Open Docker Desktop. 2. Go to Settings > General. 3. Enable Use the WSL 2 based engine. 4. Restart Docker.

🚨 Warning: Enabling WSL 2 may erase your existing containers and build history. If you have important containers, consider backing them up before switching.

For more details, refer to Docker's official documentation.

Development¶
Formatting & Linting¶
Auto formatter and linter are set up in the project. To run them:

Install:


poetry install --with dev
Format the code:


poetry run format
Lint the code:


poetry run lint
Testing¶
To run the tests:


poetry run test
To update stored snapshots after intentional API changes:


pytest --snapshot-update
Project Outline¶
The current project has the following main modules:

blocks¶
This module stores all the Agent Blocks, which are reusable components to build a graph that represents the agent's behavior.

data¶
This module stores the logical model that is persisted in the database. It abstracts the database operations into functions that can be called by the service layer. Any code that interacts with Prisma objects or the database should reside in this module. The main models are: * block: anything related to the block used in the graph * execution: anything related to the execution graph execution * graph: anything related to the graph, node, and its relations

execution¶
This module stores the business logic of executing the graph. It currently has the following main modules: * manager: A service that consumes the queue of the graph execution and executes the graph. It contains both pieces of logic. * scheduler: A service that triggers scheduled graph execution based on a cron expression. It pushes an execution request to the manager.

server¶
This module stores the logic for the server API. It contains all the logic used for the API that allows the client to create, execute, and monitor the graph and its execution. This API service interacts with other services like those defined in manager and scheduler.

utils¶
This module stores utility functions that are used across the project. Currently, it has two main modules: * process: A module that contains the logic to spawn a new process. * service: A module that serves as a parent class for all the services in the project.

Service Communication¶
Currently, there are only 3 active services:

AgentServer (the API, defined in server.py)
ExecutionManager (the executor, defined in manager.py)
Scheduler (the scheduler, defined in scheduler.py)
The services run in independent Python processes and communicate through an IPC. A communication layer (service.py) is created to decouple the communication library from the implementation.

Currently, the IPC is done using Pyro5 and abstracted in a way that allows a function decorated with @expose to be called from a different process.

Adding a New Agent Block¶
To add a new agent block, you need to create a new class that inherits from Block and provides the following information: * All the block code should live in the blocks (backend.blocks) module. * input_schema: the schema of the input data, represented by a Pydantic object. * output_schema: the schema of the output data, represented by a Pydantic object. * run method: the main logic of the block. * test_input & test_output: the sample input and output data for the block, which will be used to auto-test the block. * You can mock the functions declared in the block using the test_mock field for your unit tests. * Once you finish creating the block, you can test it by running poetry run pytest -s test/block/test_block.py.
