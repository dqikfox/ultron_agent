# Ultron Agent 2.0 – Advanced Architecture and Design Plan

## Introduction
This document presents a comprehensive design for an upgraded Ultron AI agent, synthesizing features from the current Ultron system and cutting-edge autonomous agent frameworks. The goal is to architect the most advanced Ultron agent possible, leveraging all relevant technologies identified in the provided codebase and documentation. The result is a blueprint for an Ultron agent that is both highly interactive (voice, vision, GUI) and deeply autonomous (proactive task planning, self-optimization), along with a clear technical roadmap for implementation. All recommendations prioritize maintainability, security, and extensibility.

## 1. Current Ultron System Overview
- **Voice Recognition:** Multi-engine STT with noise reduction and wake-word activation.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Unified voice engine (pyttsx3) with configurable properties.
- **LLM Brain:** Integrates OpenAI GPT models and can fall back to local LLMs (Ollama, etc.).
- **Vision/OCR:** Screen capture and OCR with Tesseract, multi-language support.
- **Pokedex-Style GUI:** Retro GUI with subsystem indicators, console, tasks, and controls.
- **System Monitoring:** Real-time CPU, RAM, disk usage, and performance metrics.
- **File System AI:** Intelligent file management and sorting (ML-based, planned).
- **System Automation:** OS automation (open apps, screenshots, shutdown, etc.).
- **Error Handling:** Robust logging, global exception hook, graceful degradation.
- **Security:** Config encryption, MAC whitelist, safe mode, restricted commands.
- **Extensibility:** Modular config, togglable modules, plugin-based tools.

## 2. Autonomy and Decision-Making (AutoGPT Lessons)
- **Chain-of-Thought Planning:** Internal reasoning loop (thought → action → observation → refined thought).
- **Tool Use:** Expose a library of actions (tools) for the LLM to invoke.
- **Long-Term Memory:** Persistent knowledge store (vector DB, e.g., FAISS/Chroma).
- **Self-Criticism:** Feedback step for error diagnosis and plan adjustment.
- **Goal-Driven Autonomy:** Event/trigger framework for proactive, scheduled, or sensor-based actions.
- **Modular Reasoning:** Planning logic separated from execution; future multi-agent support.
- **Safety:** Confirmation for risky actions, sandboxing, audit logging, fail-safes.

## 3. Proposed Advanced Architecture
### 3.1 Core AI Engine
- Dynamic model selection (OpenAI, Ollama, local LLMs).
- Context management and prompt engineering.
- Chain-of-thought orchestration (ReAct/AutoGPT loop).
- Response caching and optimization.

### 3.2 Multi-Modal Interface
- Voice (wake word, multi-engine STT, TTS, custom voices).
- GUI (real-time indicators, logs, config toggles, themes).
- Web/API (REST endpoints, web dashboard, remote control).
- Vision (OCR, image captioning, webcam support).

### 3.3 Autonomous Task Orchestrator
- Goal management and prioritization.
- Planning/reasoning loop with LLM.
- Tool library integration (plugin system).
- Event/trigger handling (scheduler, file system, alerts).

### 3.4 Memory and Knowledge Store
- Short-term memory (recent context window).
- Long-term memory (vector DB, semantic search).
- Memory governance (privacy, reset, local storage).

### 3.5 Tool/Plugin System
- File operations, system controls, web/networking, external services, code execution.
- Plugin architecture: tools as modules, permission levels, sandboxing.

### 3.6 Vision and Perception
- Screen analysis, image understanding, real-world inputs, vision output.

### 3.7 System Control & External Integration
- OS automation, external service integration (email, IoT), future multi-user support.

### 3.8 Security and Safety Layer
- Permission model, sandboxing, audit logging, fail-safes.

## 4. Technical Roadmap
### Phase 1: Foundation
- Modularize codebase, complete stubs, enhance logging/config, implement basic API.
### Phase 2: Autonomy Framework
- Integrate agent loop (LangChain/custom), develop core tool plugins, memory persistence, GUI/UX updates, scenario testing.
### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities
- Add more plugins, local LLM integration, persistent learning, cloud deployment, self-monitoring.
### Phase 4: Polishing
- User testing, performance optimization, security auditing, documentation.

## 5. Implementation Notes
- **Keys and Config:** Use `keys.txt` for API keys, `ultron_config.json` for settings. Prioritize Ollama/local LLMs for privacy and cost.
- **Plugin System:** Tools in `tools/` folder, each as a subclass of `Tool`.
- **Memory:** Use FAISS/Chroma for vector memory if available, fallback to list.
- **Security:** Enforce MAC whitelist, safe mode, and permission checks for all tool actions.
- **Extensibility:** Add new tools/plugins by dropping modules in `tools/`.
- **Voice/GUI:** Enable via config; support multiple engines and themes.

## 6. Example: Brain Module (LLM Planner)
See `brain.py` for the modular LLM planner. It:
- Builds prompts with tool descriptions and memory context.
- Queries LLM (Ollama/OpenAI/local).
- Parses tool/action calls and executes tools.
- Supports multi-step reasoning (expandable to full ReAct/AutoGPT loop).

---

## 7. Setup Instructions (Summary)
1. Install Ollama and run `ollama run llama3`.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ensure `requests` is included).
3. Replace dummy keys in `keys.txt` as needed.
4. Run the agent: `python main.py` (or via `run.bat`).
5. Configure features in `ultron_config.json`.
