# LM Studio Plugin Scaffold

Welcome to your new project! This scaffold is a starting point for building a LM Studio plugin using TypeScript.

## Getting Started

### Development

The source code resides in the `src/` directory. For development purposes, you can run the plugin in development mode using:

```bash
lms dev
```

### Publishing

To share your plugin with the community, you can publish it to LM Studio Hub using:

```bash
lms push
```

The same command can also be used to update an existing plugin.
